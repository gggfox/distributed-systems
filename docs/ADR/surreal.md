## Why Surreal
I'm planning in using this project to learn more about microservices,
using a relational database doesn't seem a good fit because of the 
one database per microservice approach. Surreal is a NewSQL DB written in Rust
it is built with distribution in mind. It is a mixture of document, graph and key value stores
